        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>
          Our journey with food started long before Yaab Burgers was even an idea. It began in busy family
          kitchens – the smell of spices simmering, pans sizzling, and everyone moving around the stove like
          it was second nature. We grew up around restaurants and home kitchens in Hull and Bristol, where
          food was never just dinner; it was culture, family, and the way we showed love.
        </p>
        <p>
          From early on, we were the ones who couldn’t leave recipes alone. We’d step into the kitchen to
          remix the dishes we knew, throw in something unexpected and see what happened. That curiosity – and
          confidence with big, layered flavours – is the heart of Yaab Burgers.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the flavours that shaped us comes from the Horn of Africa – a deep, warming spice blend that
          instantly transforms whatever it touches. It was the kind of seasoning that found its way into
          everything: marinades, slow-cooked dishes, even house sauces. It taught us how much character a
          single blend of spices can bring to a plate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yaab Burgers was born from the idea of taking those bold, nostalgic flavours and building something
          modern around them: fried chicken, burgers and sides that feel familiar at first bite, but reveal
          something more with every chew. Crispy chicken dipped in our house spice sauce, soft buns, sharp
          pickles and proper punchy condiments – all designed to carry that flavour story forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          The name “Yaab” comes from a word that captures a feeling of astonishment and surprise – that moment
          when something tastes better than you were expecting. That’s exactly how we want people to feel when
          they bite into our food: a little caught off guard, in the best possible way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Yaab Burgers is a small team with big flavours. We’re rooted in the food traditions we grew up
          with, inspired by the Horn of Africa and shaped by the cities we’ve called home. Every service is an
          opportunity to share that story – one burger, one box of fried chicken, one “wait… what is this?”
          reaction at a time.
