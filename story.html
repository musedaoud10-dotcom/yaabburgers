            <p>
              My journey with food started way before Yaab Burgers was even a thing. It really began in the kitchen — proper childhood memories: the smell of spices simmering, pans sizzling, and everyone moving like it’s second nature. I grew up watching both my parents (they were professional chefs) run Somali restaurants in Hull and Bristol through the 90s and into the late noughties. In our house, food wasn’t just dinner — it was culture, family, and how we showed love.
            </p>

            <p>
              I was always the kid experimenting. I’d go into the kitchen just to remix traditional recipes, throw in something unexpected, and see if it worked. That curiosity — and that confidence with big flavours — is basically the whole heart of Yaab.
            </p>

            <p>
              One of the flavours I grew up with is berbere. It’s originally Ethiopian, but it’s also used a lot in Somali and Eritrean cooking. For us, it was one of those spices that just elevated everything. We’d use it to deepen flavour, and even when making our own basbaas.
            </p>

            <p>
              And “Yaab” in Somali can mean astonishment, surprise — even shock. That’s exactly what I want people to feel when they bite into these burgers. Like, wait… what is this? In the best way. WA YAAB!

            <p><strong>Yaab</strong> — Somali: astonishment / surprise / shock.</p>
            <p><strong>Basbaas</strong> — Somali chilli sauce (usually homemade; can vary by household).</p>
            <p><strong>Berbere</strong> — a spiced seasoning blend from Ethiopia, also widely used across the Horn of Africa (including Somali and Eritrean cooking).</p>
            <p><strong>Wa yaab!</strong> — “How surprising!” / “That’s amazing!” / an excited “No way!” kind of reaction.</p>
